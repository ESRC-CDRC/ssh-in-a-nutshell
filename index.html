## Remote Access to Servers

<aside class="notes">
  Servers provide more central way of managing resources, e.g., computation, storage.

## GUI Tools


- Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop

## Welcome to The World of Termin~~ator~~als

Why SSH?
- Default on almost every *NIX based systems
- Light-weighted (text-based UI/CUI)
- Low requirement on network bandwidth
- Time-proved secure

## Tools for SSH

- ssh - defualt most *NIX like systems (Linux/Mac OS)
- [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) - Straight forward on Windows
- [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com) - A larger collection of tools ported from *NIX like systems

<aside class="notes">
  PuTTY is the most straight forward for logging into a SSH service.
  The latter one (Cygwin) is a bunch of commandline tools mimic-ing *NIX based system, with which you can do a lot things including SSH-ing to a server.

## When you ssh-ed to a server...

You will see ```<username>@<host>:~$```

- This is called *prompt*, indicating that the system is waiting for your orders
- It shows basic information about the current environment, your login, the host, and current directory


<aside class="notes">
  The tilde symbol (~) means your home directory, which is usually located at /home/username.
  But this may vary on different systems and you may check it by 'pwd'.

## When you ssh-ed to a server...

Basic format of command

```<command> [parameter1 [parameter2] ... ]```

- Change current directory

  ```cd another/directory```

- List current directory

  ```ls an/directory``` or simply ```ls```

<aside class="notes">
  Please notice that there are two way of interpreting a path to a directory.
  Relative path (that starting with no slash(/)) means a path starting from your current directory.
  At any moment you are sitting in a directory called "current working directy", you may find it in the prompt.
  Absolute path (that strating with a slash(/)) means a path starting for the system root and there is only one root for each system.
  Any file can be find by the two formats of path and the only difference is the number of keys you need to press.

## A bit more...

-  Copy file

  ```cp path/to/source path/to/target```
  
- Move file

  ```mv path/to/source path/to/target``` 

<aside class="notes">
  You may use mv for renaming a file.
  Please notice, these command is running only on the server and cannot copy/move files across networks.
  The topic will be visited shortly.

## Starting a R/Python environment

Just like entering any other command

- Starting a commandline environment of R

  ```R``` 

- Starting a commandline environment of Python
  
  ```python```

<aside class="notes">
  These are called commandline environment where you type R/Python statement and the environment will run each statement after you hit the enter key.

## Copy/Move between machines

- Linux/MacOS

  In your terminal with command 

  + ```scp local/file <username>@<host>:path/to/target``` 

  + ```scp <username>@<host>:path/to/source local/file ``` 

- Windows
  
  + [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)
  
  + ```scp``` in Cygwin/PuTTY Toolkit

## Running a R/Python script



- For R scripts

  ```R yourscript.R``` 

- For Python scripts
  
  ```python your_python_script.py```

<aside class="notes">
  Hopefully you do not need to start your program like this.
  But it will save you a lot of time if you need to run your script on several servers, as you may just copy paste the commandline to different ssh sessions.
  There are even more powerful tools for work with multi-server program, called ansible, and it can distribute your command to sever servers.

## Another bit more

Tools for better experience with terminals

-  cmder - [cmdr.net](http://cmder.net)
-  ConEmu - [conemu.github.io](https://conemu.github.io)

<aside class="notes">
  These two pieces of software do not provide anything for connection to a server, but they do making using the commandline easier.
  If you have Cygwin installed, you may config cmder/ConEmu to work together with it and cmder/ConEmu will provide you with a set nice things like multi-tabs, searching, hotkeys for copy/paste, etc.

## Passwordless Login

Passwordless doesn't mean insecure

- Generating a key-pair for your identity 

  ```ssh-keygen -c <your email address>```

  There will be several questions you need to answer.
  You may just press enter for each question.

- Copy the identity to the host.

  ```ssh-copy-id [<username>@]<host>```
  
<aside class="notes">
  The command <code>ssh-keygen</code> will generate a key pair (private key, public key) which is used for authentication.
  The private key is the one you need to keep secret to yourself, while the public key can be distributed to others who need to verify your identity.
  The command <code>ssh-copy-id</code> will send the public key to the server you usually use and the server will create record of the public key in you account.
  So the next time when you try to login to the server, the server will ask for evidence that you hold the private key matching the public key.

## Passwordless Login

- On Windows with PuTTY is hard

  - Check [Here](https://www.howtoforge.com/ssh_key_based_logins_putty), or
  - Use another client [Bitvise SSH Client](https://www.bitvise.com/ssh-client)

<aside class="notes">
  These are security tools, make sure your choice is reliable.
